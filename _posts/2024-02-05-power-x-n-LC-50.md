### | [Implement pow(x,n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)  | :orange_book:

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

Input             | Output |
------------------|--------|
x  = 2.00000, n = 10 &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 1024.00000 
x = 2.10000, n = 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; | 9.26100
x = 2.00000, n = -2 &nbsp; &nbsp; | 0.25000 |

###  Notes  

1. Brute Force Approach
   
> 2^ 12 = 2 * 2^11 = 2* 2* 2^10 and so on.. 
> This takes O(n) and could be high if n is the max 

2. Binary Exponential (i.e we halve the n everytime until n is 0) x becomes x * x, n becomes n/2 (if n was odd then we would store as extra multiply )

> 2 ^ 12 
> (2*2)^ 12/2 = 4^6
> (4 * 4) ^ 6/2 = 16 ^ 3 = 16 ^ 2 * 16 ^ 1 (Set aside - 16 ^ 1 since 1 is odd)
>  (16 * 16)^ 2/2 = 256 ^ 1 
> Answer is 256 * 16^1 (extra from above)= 4096

Make sure to use long to avoid integer overflow if n was the least integer (refer to comments on code)


**Time Complexity - O(logn) |** 
**Space Complexity - O(1)**

```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        // Use binary exponential instead of brute force approach since if o is super
        // large the time complexity will be O(o).
        // binary exponential it will be halved everytime.

        // integer range is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (-231 to 231â€“ 1).
        // if o was the least i.e -2,147,483,648
        // then converting that to positive will be 2,147,483,648 which is above range
        // of 2,147,483,647
        // hence we use long

        long nn = n;
        if (n < 0)
            nn = -1 * nn;

        double result = 1;
        while (nn > 0) {
            if (nn % 2 == 1)
                result *= x;
            x = x * x;
            nn = nn / 2;
        }
        return n < 0 ? 1 / result : result;
    }

    public double myPowRecursive(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return 1;
        if (n < 0) {
            return 1 / x * myPowRecursive(1 / x, -(n + 1));
        }
        return (n % 2 == 0) ? myPowRecursive(x * x, n / 2) : x * myPowRecursive(x * x, n / 2);
    }
}
